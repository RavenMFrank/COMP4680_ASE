# COMP4680 ASE: Total Variation Denoising
This project involves the investigation of problems in deep declarative networks [Gould et al., 2021]. 
We will specifically be focused on the problem of differentiating the solution of a total variation reconstruction problem [Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004, ยง6.3.3]. 
Concretely the total variation problem can be stated as
$$
\mathrm{minimize}_u \quad f(u,x) =  \frac{1}{2}\|Ax - b\|_2^2 + \lambda |u_{i+1}-u_i|
$$
